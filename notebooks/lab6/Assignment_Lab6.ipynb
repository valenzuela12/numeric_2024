Use two initial conditions that are very close to each other, say $(1,1,20)$ and $(1,1,20.001)$. Use your “method of choice” (adaptive/non-adaptive), and plot the distance between the two trajectories as a function of time. What do you see?\n",

    "One important limitation of numerical methods is immediately evident when approximating non-periodic dynamical systems such as the Lorenz equations: namely, *every computed solution is periodic*. That is, when we’re working in floating point arithmetic, there are only finitely many numbers that can be represented, and the solution must eventually repeat itself. When using single precision arithmetic, a typical computer can represent many more floating point numbers than we could ever perform integration steps in a numerical scheme. However, it is still possible that round-off error might introduce a periodic orbit in the numerical solution where one does not really exist. In our computations, this will not be a factor, but it is something to keep in mind."
