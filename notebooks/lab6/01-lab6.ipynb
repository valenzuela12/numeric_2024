    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For many people working in the physical sciences, the *butterfly\n",
    "effect* is a well-known phrase. But even if you are unacquainted\n",
    "with the term, its consequences are something you are intimately\n",
    "familiar with. Edward Lorenz investigated the feasibility of performing\n",
    "accurate, long-term weather forecasts, and came to the conclusion that\n",
    "*even something as seemingly insignificant as the flap of a\n",
    "butterfly’s wings can have an influence on the weather on the other side\n",
    "of the globe*. This implies that global climate modelers must\n",
    "take into account even the tiniest of variations in weather conditions\n",
    "in order to have even a hope of being accurate. Some of the models used\n",
    "today in weather forecasting have up to *a million unknown\n",
    "variables!*\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advent of modern computers, many people believed that accurate\n",
    "predictions of systems as complicated as the global weather were\n",
    "possible. Lorenz’ studies (Lorenz, 1963), both analytical and numerical, were\n",
    "concerned with simplified models for the flow of air in the atmosphere.\n",
    "He found that even for systems with considerably fewer variables than\n",
    "the weather, the long-term behaviour of solutions is intrinsically\n",
    "unpredictable. He found that this type of non-periodic, or\n",
    "*chaotic* behaviour, appears in systems that are described\n",
    "by non-linear differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The atmosphere is just one of many hydrodynamical systems, which exhibit\n",
    "a variety of solution behaviour: some flows are steady; others oscillate\n",
    "between two or more states; and still others vary in an irregular or\n",
    "haphazard manner. This last class of behaviour in a fluid is known as\n",
    "*turbulence*, or in more general systems as\n",
    "*chaos*. Examples of chaotic behaviour in physical systems\n",
    "include\n",
    "\n",
    "-   thermal convection in a tank of fluid, driven by a heated plate on\n",
    "    the bottom, which displays an irregular patter of “convection rolls”\n",
    "    for certain ranges of the temperature gradient;\n",
    "\n",

When using single precision arithmetic, a typical computer can represent many more floating point numbers than we could ever perform integration steps in a numerical scheme.

    "In this lab, you have had the chance to investigate the solutions to the Lorenz equations and their stability in quite some detail. You saw that for certain parameter values, the solution exhibits non-periodic, chaotic behaviour. The question to ask ourselves now is: *What does this system tell us about the dynamics of flows in the atmosphere?* In fact, this system has been simplified so much that it is no longer an accurate model of the physics in the atmosphere.\n",
    "However, we have seen that the four characteristics of flows in the atmosphere (mentioned in [the Introduction](#sec_intro)) are also present in the Lorenz equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each state in Lorenz’ idealized “climate” is represented by a single point in phase space. For a given set of initial conditions, the evolution of a trajectory describes how the weather varies in time. The butterfly attractor embodies all possible weather conditions that can be attained in the Lorenzian climate. By changing the value of the parameter $\\rho$ (and, for that matter, $\\sigma$ or $\\beta$), the shape of the attractor changes. Physically, we can interpret this as a change in some global property of the weather system resulting in a modification of the possible weather states.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same methods of analysis can be applied to more complicated models of the weather. One can imagine a model where the depletion of ozone and the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere might be represented by certain parameters. Changes in these parameters result in changes in the shape of the global climate attractor for the system. By studying the attractor, we could determine whether any new, and possibly devastating, weather states are present in this new ozone-deficient atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "We began by saying in the Introduction that the butterfly effect made accurate long-term forecasting impossible. Nevertheless, it is still possible to derive meaningful qualitative information from such a chaotic dynamical system.\n"
