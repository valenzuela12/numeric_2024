    "**leap-frog scheme:** This term is used to refer to time discretization schemes that use the centered difference formula to discretize the first time derivative in PDE problems. The resulting difference scheme relates the solution at the next time step to the solution *two* time steps previous. Hence, the even- and odd-numbered time steps are linked together, with the resulting computation performed in a *leap-frog* fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**periodic boundary conditions:** Spatial boundary conditions where the value of the solution at one end of the domain is required to be equal to the value on the other end (compare to dirichlet boundary values, where the the solution at both ends is fixed at a specific value or values). This enforces periodicity on the solution, and in terms of a fluid flow problem, these conditions can be thought of more intuitively as requiring that any flow out of the one boundary must return through the corresponding boundary on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "**computational mode:** When performing a modal analysis of a numerical scheme, this is a mode in the solution that does not correspond to any of the \"real\" (or physical) modes in the continuous problem. It is an artifact of the discretization process only, and can sometimes lead to spurious computational results (for example, with the leap-frog time stepping scheme)."
