    "\n",
    "It is obvious that life on earth is highly sensitive to the planet’s\n",
    "atmospheric and climatic conditions. What is less obvious, but of great\n",
    "interest, is the role biology plays in the sensitivity of the climate.\n",
    "This is dramatically illustrated by the concern over the possible\n",
    "contribution to global warming by the loss of the rain forests in\n",
    "Brazil.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that each may affect the other implies that the climate and\n",
    "life on earth are interlocked in a complex series of feedbacks, i.e. the\n",
    "climate affects the biosphere which, when altered, then changes the\n",
    "climate and so on. A fascinating question arises as to whether or not\n",
    "this would eventually lead to a stable climate. This scenerio is\n",
    "exploited to its fullest in the <span>*Gaia*</span> hypothesis which\n",
    "postulates that the biosphere, atmosphere, ocean and land are all part\n",
    "of some totality, dubbed <span>*Gaia*</span>, which is essentially an\n",
    "elaborate feedback system which optimizes the conditions of life here on\n",
    "earth.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be hopeless to attempt to mathematically model such a large,\n",
    "complex system. What can be done instead is to construct a ’toy model’\n",
    "of the system in which much of the complexity has been stripped away and\n",
    "only some of the relevant characteristics retained. The resulting system\n",
    "will then be tractable but, unfortunately, may bear little connection\n",
    "with the original physical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld is such a model. Life on Daisyworld has been reduced to just\n",
    "two species of daisies of different colors. The only environmental\n",
    "condition that affects the daisy growth rate is temperature. The\n",
    "temperature in turn is modified by the varying amounts of radiation\n",
    "absorbed by the daisies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld is obviously a gross simplification of the real earth.\n",
    "However, it does retain the central feature of interest: a feedback loop\n",
    "between the climate and life on the planet. Since the equations\n",
    "governing the system will be correspondingly simplified, it will allow\n",
    "us to investigate under what conditions, if any, that equilibrium is\n",
    "reached. The hope is that this will then gain us some insight into how\n",

    "### Why Adaptive Stepsize?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rule of thumb, accuracy increases in Runge-Kutta methods as stepsize decreases. At the same time, the number of function evaluations performed increases. This tradeoff between accuracy of the solution and computational cost always exists, but in the ODE solution algorithms presented earlier it often appears to be unnecessarily large. To see this, consider the solution to a problem in two different time intervals - in the first time interval, the solution is close to steady, whereas in the second one it changes quickly. For acceptable accuracy with a non-adaptive method the step size will have to be adjusted so that the approximate solution is close to the actual solution in the second interval. The stepsize will be fairly small, so that the approximate solution is able to follow the changes in the solution here. However, as there is no change in stepsize throughout the solution process, the same step size will be applied to approximate the solution in the first time interval, where clearly a much larger stepsize would suffice to achieve the same accuracy. Thus, in a region where the solution behaves nicely a lot of function evaluations are wasted because the stepsize is chosen in accordance with the most quickly changing part of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to address this problem is the use of adaptive stepsize control. This class of algorithms adjusts the stepsize taken in a time interval according to the properties of the solution in that interval, making it useful for producing a solution that has a given accuracy in the minimum number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"sec_design\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing Adaptive Stepsize Control\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the goal is clear, the question remains of how to close in on it. As mentioned above, an adaptive  algorithm is usually asked to solve a problem to a desired accuracy. To be able to adjust the stepsize in Runge-Kutta the algorithm must therefore calculate some estimate of how far its solution deviates from the actual solution. If with its initial stepsize this estimate is already well within the desired accuracy, the algorithm can proceed with a larger stepsize. If the error estimate is larger than the desired accuracy, the algorithm decreases the stepsize at this point and attempts to take a smaller step. Calculating this error estimate will always increase the amount of work done at a step compared to non-adaptive methods. Thus, the remaining problem is to devise a method of calculating this error estimate that is both\n",

    "<a name=\"sec_doubling\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Estimate by Step Doubling\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and simple approach to arriving at an error estimate is to simply take every step twice. The second time the step is divided up into two steps, producing a different estimate of the solution. The difference in the two solutions can be used to produce an estimate of the truncation error for this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "How expensive is this method to estimate the error? A single step of fourth order Runge-Kutta always takes four function evaluations. As the second time the step is taken in half-steps, it will take 8 evaluations.\n",
    "However, the first function evaluation in taking a step twice is identical to both steps, and thus the overall cost for one step with step doubling is $12 - 1 = 11$ function evaluations. This should be compared to taking two normal half-steps as this corresponds to the overall accuracy achieved. So we are looking at 3 function evaluations more per step, or an increase of computational cost by a factor of $1.375$.\n",

    "Another way of estimating the truncation error of a step is due to the existence of the special fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods discussed earlier. These methods use six function evaluations which can be recombined to produce a fourth-order method . Again, the difference between the fifth and the fourth order solution is used to calculate an\n",
    "estimate of the truncation error. Obviously this method requires fewer function evaluations than step doubling, as the two estimates use the same evaluation points. Originally this method was found by Fehlberg, and later Cash and Karp produced the set of constants presented earlier that produce an efficient and accurate error estimate."

The code was used in the earlier sections to find some adhoc steady state solutions and the effect of altering some of the model parameters. What is of interest now is the effect of the daisy feedback on the range of parameter values for which non-zero steady states exist. That the feedback does have an effect on the steady states was readily seen in [Problem initial](#prob_initial).\n",
