These high waveumbers consequently appear as lower modes in the solution due to aliasing. If the scheme is such that these high wavenumber modes are amplified, then the aliased modes can lead to a significant error in the computed solution.\n",

If $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the rotating frame, and $\\vec u$ is the velocity of an object observed within the rotating frame, then the Coriolis force, $\\Omega \\times \\vec u$, appears as a force tending to deflect the moving object to the right.\n",

    "- **hydrostatic balance:** A balance, in the vertical direction, between the vertical pressure gradient and the buoyancy force. The pressure difference between any two points on a vertical line is assumed to depend only on the weight of the fluid between the points, as if the fluid were at rest, even though it is actually in motion. This approximation leads to a simplification in the equations of fluid flow, by replacing the vertical momentum equation.\n",
    "- **incompressible fluid:** A fluid for which changes in the density with pressure are negligible. For a fluid with velocity field, $\\vec u$, this is expressed by the equation $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec u = 0$. This equation states that the local increase of density with time must be balanced by the divergence of the mass flux.\n",
