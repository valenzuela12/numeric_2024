    "\n",
    "The last scheme presented solves 2 problems introduced in the previous\n",
    "two schemes. The centred differencing scheme lacks positive definiteness\n",
    "because it is of second order accuracy, thus it introduces additional\n",
    "oscillations near the peak. The scheme presented here solves this\n",
    "problem by checking and normalising the relevant values (ie, $I_{j+1/2}$\n",
    "and $I_j$) when needed at each time step. The upstream scheme produces\n",
    "strong diffusion because it is of only first order accuracy. The scheme\n",
    "presented here solves this problem by using higher order polynomials to\n",
    "approximate $c$ at each grid box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments have shown that this scheme is numerically stable in most\n",
    "atmospheric situations. This scheme is only slightly unstable in the\n",
    "case of strong deformational flow field models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detail about this advection scheme , please refer to ([Bott, 1989](#Ref:Bott)).\n",
