    "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in many physical situations. For example, there is the first-order Newton cooling equation discussed in Lab 1, and perhaps the most famous equation of all, the second-order Newton’s Second Law of Mechanics $F=ma$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, higher-order equations, such as Newton’s force equation, can be rewritten as a system of first-order equations . So the generic problem in ODEs is a set of N coupled first-order differential equations of the form, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\frac{d{\\bf y}}{dt} = f({\\bf y},t)\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "where ${\\bf y}$ is a vector of\n",
    "variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a complete specification of the solution, boundary conditions for the problem must be given. Typically, the problems are broken up into two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Initial Value Problem (IVP)**: the initial values of\n",
    "    ${\\bf y}$ are specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Boundary Value Problem (BVP)**: ${\\bf y}$ is\n",
    "    specified at the initial and final times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we are concerned with the IVP’s. BVP’s tend to be much more difficult to solve and involve techniques which will not be dealt with in this set of labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as was pointed out in Lab 2, in general, it will not be possible to find exact, analytic solutions to the ODE. However, it is possible to find an approximate solution with a finite difference scheme such as the forward Euler method. This is a simple first-order, one-step scheme which is easy to implement. However, this method is rarely used in practice as it is neither very stable nor accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher-order Taylor methods discussed in Lab 2 are one alternative but involve higher-order derivatives that must be calculated by hand or worked out numerically in a multi-step scheme. Like the forward Euler method, stability is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Runge-Kutta methods are higher-order, one-step schemes that make use of information at different <span>*stages*</span> between the beginning and end of a step. They are more stable and accurate than the forward Euler method and are still relatively simple compared to schemes such as the multi-step predictor-corrector methods or the Bulirsch-Stoer method. Though they lack the accuracy and efficiency of these more sophisticated schemes, they are still powerful methods that almost always succeed for non-stiff IVPs."
